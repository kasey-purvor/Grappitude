### A Makers Academy Final Project

Introduction to final project, with a link to everyone's github account.  What does the app actually do and why?

Details on the planning stage - multiple ideas, advanced a couple of them to discuss how the coding would work.  Settled on one with an interesting code feature (power bar).
Decided on javascript and REACT NATIVE as this would be a challenge for us all.
Sequence Diagrams.
Trello Board and Tickets.
Self lead learning.

MVP.

What went well?
  Self learning.
  Developed MVP fluidly
  Knowledge sharing

Things to improve upon
  Code reviews - we are still in the headspace where we want to merge as a team.
  Testing - more of an afterthought.
  Team structure - Product Owner etc could have helped drive results.
